# 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan

## 👤 Current Level
I am a **student (IT background)** currently building strong fundamentals in Linux, cloud, and automation.  
I have basic experience with Linux commands, Python scripting, Git, and AWS labs, and I want to transition into a **practical DevOps engineer** role.

---

## 💡 My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud
DevOps is not just tools.  
It is the **discipline of building, deploying, and operating systems reliably** using automation, monitoring, and collaboration.

Cloud provides **on-demand infrastructure**, and DevOps ensures that this infrastructure is:
- repeatable
- observable
- scalable
- production-ready

---

## 🎯 Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
- I want **real engineering skills**, not just theory
- I want to be confident debugging Linux, Docker, CI/CD, and cloud failures
- I want a **job-ready DevOps profile** with real projects, not certificates only

---

## 🚀 Where I Want to Reach (After 90 Days)
By the end of 90 days, I want to:
1. Deploy a **production-style application** using Docker and Kubernetes
2. Build and run **CI/CD pipelines** (GitHub Actions)
3. Operate cloud infrastructure on **AWS** with confidence

---

## 🧠 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build
1. **Linux & systemd troubleshooting**
2. **Docker + Kubernetes fundamentals & debugging**
3. **CI/CD automation & Cloud (AWS) basics**

---

## ⏱ Weekly Time Commitment
- **Weekdays:** 2–2.5 hours/day
- **Weekends:** 4–6 hours/day
- Minimum commitment: **15–18 hours/week**

Consistency > intensity.

---

## 🔁 How I Will Stay Consistent
- Daily terminal practice (even 30 minutes counts)
- Write notes or code **every day**
- Push progress to GitHub weekly
- Learn in public (LinkedIn / README updates)
- Focus on execution, not perfection

---

## 🧭 Mindset
I will treat this plan like a **real DevOps job**:
- I take ownership of my learning
- I debug instead of giving up
- I focus on fundamentals before tools

---

## ✅ 90 Days Outcome
At the end of this journey, I aim to be a **confident junior DevOps engineer** with:
- real projects
- clear fundamentals
- strong execution habits
